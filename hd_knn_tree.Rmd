# K-nearest neighbor and Decision Tree
This project is to apply K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree to the heart disease dataset and apply fitted model to predict the potential patient. Also, the models are compared with the Logistic Regression for their accuracy and predictability.

The [hd_log_reg](https://github.com/danypark91/hd_log_reg/blob/main/hd_log_reg_rmarkdown.md) already consists extensive explanation of the dataset. The project includes data visualization of the same dataframe. It will walk through the step-by-step procedure of the regression analysis and the performance of the predicted model.

## 1. K-nearest neighbor
### 1-1. Overview of KNN

K-nearest neighbors(KNN) is considered to be one of the most simplest and well-known non-parametric methods. The algorithm does not assume the parametric form, which allows more flexible approach to perform analysis. The classification method indentifies the given K points that are closest to the training independent variable x0. Then the conditional probability for a particular class is estimated. The largest probability is used for KNN to apply Bayes Rule and classify the test observations.

For example, assume that the K is chosen to be 3. Within the distanced boundary, two blue points are captured along with the orange point. The estimate probability for the blue equals to 2/3 and orange to 1/3. Then the algorithm predicts the boundary's class as blue. The right-hand side presents the decision boundary of all possible values of x0 with applying KNN algorithm and k=3. 


### 1-2. Importation and Alteration of Data
Before proceeding straight into the algorithm, I imported the project's dataframe. Like the previous logistic regression project, the erronous attribute name was corrected. However this time, the `knn` function required the only response variable as a factor(categorical variable).

```{r Data Importation, echo=FALSE}
#Import Dataset from the local device
df <- read.csv("Heart.csv", header = TRUE)

#change erronous attribute name: ï..age
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=='ï..age'] <- 'age'

#Check the type and convert the dependent variable into factors
df$target <- as.factor(df$target)
```
Also, prior to the analysis, normalization of dependent variable was conducted to equalize the weight and range. The `normalize` function helped to acquire the condition. The normalized dataset was divided into two sets: `train_df` was used to apply and train the `knn` alogorithm and the measure of predictability utlized the `test_df`.

```{r Normaliztion, echo=FALSE}
#Normalization function
normalize <- function(x){
  return ((x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x)))
}

norm_df <- as.data.frame(lapply(df[,1:13], normalize))
head(norm_df,5)

#Combine the normalized dataframe with the target variable
norm_df <- cbind(norm_df, df$target)
colnames(norm_df)[colnames(norm_df)=="df$target"] <- "target"
head(norm_df,5)

#Split into Train and Test Datasets
library(caTools)
set.seed(1234)

sample = sample.split(norm_df, SplitRatio = 0.75)
train_df = subset(norm_df, sample==TRUE)
test_df = subset(norm_df,sample==FALSE)
```

### 1-3. Selection of K
As the algorithm is based on the distance based on the value of K, it is extremely important to choose appropriate value. The below image illustrates the difference betwen k=3 and k=5. The result of the choice between those values could significantly differ from one another. In order to choose the right K, `knn` should be performed multiple times and choose the K that has the least errors. 

![Difference](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/KnnClassification.svg/330px-KnnClassification.svg.png)

There are couple of points to consider:

* K is a positive integer
* K -> 1, less stable prediction
* As K increases, prediction becomes more stable. However, if the error increases, then rerun of `knn` could stop
* If tiebreaking within the range of K, then choose odd number

The below run is the sample run of KNN with K=15. The rate of error of prediction on the `test_df` is as low as 0.2209. The result can be considered as an accurate model. However, as stated above, `knn` should be performed multiple times with different K values to determine the best-fit model.

```{r Sample KNN run, echo=FALSE}
#K-Nearest Neighbor sample run, k=15
library(class)
knn_15 <- knn(train=train_df[1:13], test=test_df[1:13], cl=train_df$target, k=15)

#Predictability of the above model
table(knn_15, test_df$target)
print(paste("Error: ", round(mean(knn_15 != test_df$target),4))) #knn error rate
```

To minimize the effort, the list of error based on the value of k was created. For-loop command helped to populate the sequential list of error for K between 1 to 15. The graph represents the list, `knn-err`, and the value of K. As the trend suggests, error rate decreases significantly after k=4 and bounces back at 10. 8, 9 and 10 are the most accurate models for the dataframe. However, as the tiebreaking rule suggests, 9 is chosen to proceed further steps for the analysis.

```{r For Loop KNN from 1 to 15, echo=FALSE}
#Error vs number of neighbors
knn_err <- list() #empty list

for (i in 1:15){
  #KNN
  temp <- mean((knn(train=train_df[1:13], test=test_df[1:13], cl=train_df$target, k=i)) != test_df$target)
  knn_err[[i]] <- temp
}

#Plot of K vs Error list
x <- seq(1, 15, by=1)
knn_errplot <- plot(x, knn_err, type="b", axes=TRUE,
                    xlab="K", ylab="Error Rate", main="K vs Error of KNN", col="Red")
```
The exact rate of error of the K=9 model is 0.1744 which lower than the k=15 model. Of course the accuracy of the model compare to the `test_df` reponse variable is 0.8256. 
```{r K=9, echo=FALSE}
#K=9, Fit KNN
df_knn_model <- knn(train=train_df[1:13], test=test_df[1:13], cl=train_df$target, k=9)
df_knn_model_acc <- mean(df_knn_model == test_df$target)
df_knn_model_err <- mean(df_knn_model != test_df$target)

print(paste("Accuracy of the Model : ", round(df_knn_model_acc,4)))
print(paste("Error of the Model : ", round(df_knn_model_err,4)))
```

### 1-4. Prediction and Performance Measure
As we dicovered the best-fit model of `KNN`, we should examine the model's predictability and its performance. The most commonly used technics are Confusion Matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. A confusion matrix is a table used to exhibit the classification result on the test dataset. It contains two dimensions, ‘actual’ and ‘predicted’, and the cells are determined by the number of categories in a response variable. The below image explains the meaning of each cell and significant metrics.

![Confusion Matrix](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EvSXDotTOwc/XMfeOGZ-CVI/AAAAAAAAEiE/oePFfvhfOQM11dgRn9FkPxlegCXbgOF4QCLcBGAs/s1600/confusionMatrxiUpdated.jpg)

The confusion matrix states that the accuracy of the 9-nearest neighbor for the dataframe is 0.8256 with the 95% confidence interval of 0.7287 and 0.8990. The prediction result of the model is very promising in terms of the predictability. The error of the model is 0.1744: 8 patients are categorized as Type I error where as 7 patients suffered Type II error. As the dataframe is related to health issues, Type II error could cause a devastating result. 
```{r Confusion Matrix, echo=FALSE}
#Confusion Matrix of the KNN
library(caret)
df_knn_conf <- confusionMatrix(factor(df_knn_model), factor(test_df$target), positive=as.character(1))
df_knn_conf
```

```{r ROC and AUC, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
library(kknn)
df_knn_model.alt <- train.kknn(as.factor(target)~., train_df, ks=9,  method="knn", scale=TRUE)
df_knn_model_fit <- predict(df_knn_model.alt, test_df, type="prob")[,2]

#ROC and AUC of the plot
library(ROCR)
df_knn_prediction <- prediction(df_knn_model_fit, test_df$target)
df_knn_performance <- performance(df_knn_prediction, measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
df_knn_roc <- plot(df_knn_performance, col="Red",
                   main="ROC Curve - 9NN",
                   xlab="False Positive Rate",
                   ylab="True Positive Rate")+
  abline(a=0, b=1, col="Grey", lty=2)+
  abline(v=0, h=1, col="Blue", lty=3)+
  plot(df_knn_performance, col="Red",add=TRUE)

df_knn_auc <- performance(df_knn_prediction, measure = "auc")
df_knn_auc <- df_knn_auc@y.values[[1]]
df_knn_auc
```
